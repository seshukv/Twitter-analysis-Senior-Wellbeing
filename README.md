<h1>Senior Citizen Well-Being: Twitter Analysis</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>
This project aims to enhance the well-being of senior citizens by analyzing tweets related to them. The project focuses on sentiment analysis and topic modeling to gain insights into the senior citizens concerns and emotions.

<h3>Data Collection</h3>
The tweets were collected using Twitter API and were filtered based on relevant keywords related to senior citizens and COVID-19. The data was then pre-processed using natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as stop-word removal, lemmatization, and stemming.

<h3>Data Analysis</h3>
The pre-processed data were vectorized using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a pre-trained deep learning model, to extract meaningful features. Topic modeling and sentiment analysis were performed using the vectorized data to uncover the main concerns of senior citizens and their sentiment. The algorithms implemented for sentiment analysis and Topic modeling are RoBERTa from huggingface and BERTTopic.

<h3>Results</h3>
The results of the analysis were visualized using various charts, including pie charts, bar graphs, and word clouds, to provide easy-to-understand insights into the senior citizens' concerns and emotions.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
This project provides an insight into the well-being of senior citizens during the COVID-19 pandemic, which can help policymakers and stakeholders to make informed decisions to improve the quality of life for this vulnerable population.
